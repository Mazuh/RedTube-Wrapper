# RedTube Wrapper

Simply a wrapper for the official [RedTube API](https://api.redtube.com/docs/)
-- ie, there isn't any kind of user interface here, not even command lines.
May have [NSFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work) language, but,
again, there's no porn here, you pervert. It's just Kotlin code (no, not
even Python), which is exciting by itself, of course!

> Although I strongly recommend you to **step back** if **you're underage**

If you're planning to use this knowledge to create something dirty... well,
you're naughty programmer, but have [fun](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html)!
Just follow the legal notices here below, it's very important to respect the companies and developers
who worked _hard_ on that.

## Legal notices

All this repository is under [LGPL license](https://github.com/Mazuh/RedTube-Wrapper/blob/master/LICENSE), so pay very attention
before using this code.

Before starting this project and hosting its code at GitHub, I had read
[GitHub Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/)
and contacted them. Apparently, some dirty keywords won't
hurt anyone, but don't expect GitHub to host pornography, nudity or explicit sexual
content. All information this wrapper provides is actually provided by RedTube
itself (that's why this is a wrapper) through Internet, and this wrapper alone have no
intention of persist or host the retrieved data.

As an **indie project**, there's no company endorsing it, not even RedTube.
Ipso facto, RedTube and its associated logos and names are **not** my trademarks
nor service marks. I do not own any content that may be retrieved using this
wrapper, also.

Note that whenever you use this wrapper to access RedTube API, you're also making use of a RedTube
Service. That said, be aware of [RedTube Terms of Service](https://www.redtube.com/information#terms).
