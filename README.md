# RedTube Wrapper

Simply a wrapper for the official [RedTube API](https://api.redtube.com/docs/).
May have [NSFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work) language, but
there's no porn here, you pervert. It's just Java code (no, not even Python),
a myriad of classes, exceptions, objects, requests etc.

If you're planning to use this knowledge to create something dirty... well,
you're naughty programmer, but have fun! Just follow the legal notice here
below, it's very important to respect the companies and developers who worked
_hard_ on that.

## Legal notices

All this repository is under [LGPL license](./LICENSE), so pay very attention
to it if you gonna use some of this code.

Before starting this project and making it available here, I had read
[GitHub Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/)
and contacted them. Apparently, some dirty keywords won't
hurt anyone, but don't expect GitHub to host pornography, nudity or explicit sexual
content. All information this wrapper provides is actually provided by RedTube
itself (that's why this is a wrapper) through Internet, and system have no
intention of persist or host the retrieved data.

As an **indie project**, there's no company endorsing it, not even RedTube.
Ipso facto, RedTube and its associated logos and names are **not** my trademarks
nor service marks. I do not own any content that may be retrieved using this
wrapper, also.

Note that whenever you use this wrapper to access RedTube API, you're also making use of a RedTube
Service. That said, be aware of [RedTube Terms of Service](https://www.redtube.com/information#terms).
